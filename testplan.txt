Test 1: We created a box with the same name 3 times to see if it would print error
Create Aditya
Create Aditya: Already exists
Create Aditya: Already exists

Test 2: We opened and closed a box a bunch of times to see if the box would properly open and close.
Open DNE BOX: DNE
Open Aditya: Opened
Close Aditya: Closed
Open Aditya: Opened
Open Aditya: Already Opened
Close Aditya: Closed

Test 3: We created 4 clients, one to create and delete 3 user boxes and 3 clients for each user. We made each use open their own box, put a msg inside, go to next message, then closed the boxes.
u1:
Create Aditya
Create Hali
Create Desmond
Delete Hali
Delete Hali: DNE
Delete Aditya
Delete Aditya: DNE
Delete Desmond
Delete Desmond: DNE
Close
Close: Double free or corruption error :/

U2: 
Open Desmond
Put 10!it’s scarce
Next: 10!it’scarce
Close

U3:
Open Aditya
Put 16!what is going on
Next: Okay!16
Next: 16!it’scarce
Close

U4:
Open Hali
Put 5!hello
Next: 5!hello
Close

Observations: We believe that some clients receive messages back later than expected
